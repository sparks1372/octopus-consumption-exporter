# Octopus Energy Consumption Exporter:

[![build](https://github.com/sparks1372/octopus-consumption-exporter/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sparks1372/octopus-consumption-exporter/actions/workflows/build.yml) ![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kevalpatel2106/octopus-consumption-exporter)

Python script to pull energy consumption data from Octopus energy into InfluxDB. This can be used with Graphana dashboard to monitor the enegy usage.

### Environment variables:

| Name | Note | Required | Default value | 
|----|----|----|----|
| `INFLUX_DB_NAME` | Name of the database in influx DB where the data will be stored. | ❌ | energy |
| `INFLUX_DB_HOST` | Host address of the InfluxDB | ❌ | influxdb | 
| `INFLUX_DB_PORT` | Port on which influx DB is running | ❌ | 8086 |
| `INFLUX_DB_USER` | InfluxDB user if authentication set. | ❌ | "" |
| `INFLUX_DB_PASSWORD` | InfluxDB password if authentication set. | ❌ | "" |
| `OCTOPUS_API_KEY` | API key for accessing Octopus Energy APIs. You can generate this key from [here](https://octopus.energy/dashboard/developer/). | ✔️ | Requeired |
| `ELECTRICITY_MPAN` | MPAN for your electricity meter. [Here](https://www.comparethemarket.com/energy/content/mpan-number/) the guide on how to find it. | ✔️ | Requeired |
| `ELECTRICITY_SERIAL_NO` | Serial number of your electricity meter. You will find it on your electricity meter. | ✔️ | Requeired |
| `GAS_MPAN` | MPAN for your gas meter. [Here](https://www.comparethemarket.com/energy/content/mpan-number/) the guide on how to find it. | ✔️ | Requeired |
| `GAS_SERIAL_NO` | Serial number of your gas meter. You will find it on your gas meter. | ✔️ | Requeired |
| `VOLUME_CORRECTION_FACTOR` | Factor to convert m3 into kWh. You will find this on your last gas bill from Octopus. | ✔️ | Requeired |
| `SERIES_START_DATE` | Inital date from which the script will load the data. This date should be the date in the past. | ❌ | Yesterday's date |
